# Crunchyroll Auto Skipper
A browser extension to automatically skip openings, endings, recaps and previews on Crunchyroll.

Click the extension image to view the settings. From there choose what to skip. Extension skips everything by default.

I don't actually ever skip anything, why did I even make this. I will literally never use this.
